"""Clean blank fields out of the mid_highmid_20yr_portfolios dataset before it ever
reaches EXAMM.

WHY THIS EXISTS: EXAMM's C++ CSV parser (time_series/time_series.cxx) has no
date-awareness -- each stock's file becomes a purely positional per-column array, and on
an unparseable (blank) field it Log::errors and silently skips appending that ONE value to
that ONE column's array, permanently misaligning it against every other column from that
row forward. Not a crash -- silent corruption of feature/label alignment for the rest of
the file. This script resolves every blank before that can happen, or refuses to proceed.

Methodology independently verified across two rounds of expert review plus a design pass
that re-audited the raw data under this exact rule ordering (see the ICAIF paper-review
conversation this was built for -- ordering matters: rule 1 MUST run before rules 3/4, or
real blank-RET rows get misread as "mixed" runs that don't actually exist once rule 1 has
already dropped them).

Per-ticker pipeline, strictly ordered (see clean_ticker()):
  1. Drop rows where RET (the label) is blank -- no fill can substitute for a missing
     target. ~20 rows total, all pre-2021, none in this project's val/test years.
  2. Trim each file's full LEADING blank run (not just row 0) -- a pure prefix trim, no
     interior gap created either way. One file (KEY) has a 1,016-row leading BA_SPREAD gap.
  3. TURNOVER==0 (halt-day) domain-aware fix, corpus-wide:
       - same-day ILLIQUIDITY blank -> per-ticker sentinel, -10 * that ticker's own
         max(|ILLIQUIDITY|) elsewhere in its file (real values are tiny/signed, ~1e-9..
         1e-11; this stays proportionate to that stock's own scale and is contained to
         that one stock/column since --normalize avg_std_dev statistics are computed
         per-file).
       - VOL_CHANGE blank -> recomputed against the last NON-ZERO-turnover baseline
         instead of the halt day itself (verified: VOL_CHANGE already equals this exact
         ratio formula everywhere it's populated in the source data).
  4. BA_SPREAD forward-fill (LOCF), guarded: auto-clear a contiguous blank run only if
     BA_SPREAD is the sole blank column in that range, AND (the run is entirely dated
     before 2004-01-01 [the known vendor-outage pattern, up to 109 rows, ~121/200 files]
     OR the run is exactly 1 row long, any date [confirmed low-risk shape, same as the
     reviewed pattern]). Anything else hard-fails loudly for a human to look at.
  5. Final assertion: zero remaining blanks anywhere in RET/VOL_CHANGE/BA_SPREAD/
     ILLIQUIDITY/sprtrn/TURNOVER. No permissive fallback -- an unexplained blank stops the
     run rather than getting silently patched by an unreviewed generic rule.

# VERIFIED on all 200 tickers: TRAN_COST == BA_SPREAD * PRC / 2 exactly (max abs deviation
# 4.7e-15 -- pure floating-point noise), i.e. the standard half-spread cost model. Two
# consequences drive the handling below:
#   - TRAN_COST is blank exactly where BA_SPREAD is blank (16,808 rows, identical count).
#     Rather than fill it independently, RECOMPUTE it from the already-LOCF-filled
#     BA_SPREAD, which keeps the identity exact instead of letting the two drift apart.
#   - TRAN_COST < 0 (8,945 rows) wherever BA_SPREAD < 0, i.e. a CROSSED QUOTE (bid > ask),
#     a known CRSP artifact rather than a real negative spread. Left as-is it becomes a
#     trading SUBSIDY in Financial_toolbox (buy_stock does cash/(price + tc), so tc<0 buys
#     MORE shares). Floored at zero: a data error must not pay the strategy. Only 18 of
#     these fall inside any trading window (all 2024), so this is a correctness guard, not
#     a results-moving choice.
